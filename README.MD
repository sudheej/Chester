AI that plays against a Random Mover and generates a list of moves (UCI) and board patterns to files.

The program uses modified sunfishengine where sunfishAI plays agains a random move generating user. The idea is to generate dataset of moves where black(SunfishAI) always wins.
If RandomPlayer Wins(Suprise!) then we can re-map those as well. Still need lot of work to be done feel free to fork.
